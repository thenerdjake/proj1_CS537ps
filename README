We divided the program into 3 modules and header files that contained function
prototypes that were declared in the modules. Processing.c took care of reading
from the command line and identifying what output was needed from the given
input.  list.c iterated through the /proc directory and returned a pointer to an
array that contained the ID to user processes.  parser.c extracted strings from
the stat, statm, and cmdline files.  All these files were linked with main to
print output to console.
